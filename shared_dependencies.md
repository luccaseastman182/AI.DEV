Shared Dependencies:

1. **Manifest.json**: This file shares the names of the scripts and icons with the other files. It also shares the permissions and version details.

2. **Background.js**: This file shares the message names with the content and popup scripts. It also shares the Chrome Storage API with the content script for storing and retrieving comments.

3. **Popup.html**: This file shares the id names of DOM elements with the popup.js file. These ids are used to reference the elements in the JavaScript file.

4. **Popup.js**: This file shares the id names of DOM elements with the popup.html file. It also shares the message names with the background.js and content.js files.

5. **Popup.css**: This file shares the id and class names of DOM elements with the popup.html file. These are used to apply styles to the elements.

6. **Content.js**: This file shares the message names with the background.js and popup.js files. It also shares the Chrome Storage API with the background.js file for storing and retrieving comments.

7. **Content.css**: This file shares the id and class names of DOM elements with the content.js file. These are used to apply styles to the elements.

8. **Icon files**: These files are shared with the manifest.json file, which references them to display as the extension's icons.

9. **Data Schema**: The data schema for the comments (including the URL of the webpage, the comment text, and the timestamp) is shared between the background.js and content.js files, as they both interact with the Chrome Storage API to store and retrieve this data.

10. **Function Names**: Function names are shared between the JavaScript files (background.js, popup.js, content.js) for calling and defining functions. For example, a function to save a comment might be defined in background.js and called in content.js and popup.js.
